  To dream the impossible dream,<br>
  To fight the unbeatable foe,<br>
  To bear with unbearable sorrow,<br>
  To run where the brave dare not go;
  <br><br>

  To right the unrightable wrong,<br>
  To love pure and chaste from afar,<br>
  To try when your arms are too weary,<br>
  To reach the unreachable star;
  <br><br>

  This is my quest,<br>
  To follow this star,<br>
  No matter how hopeless,<br>
  No matter how far.
  <br><br>

  To fight for the right,<br>
  Without question or pause,<br>
  To be willing to march into hell,<br>
  For a heavenly cause.
  <br><br>

  And I know if I'll only be true,<br>
  To this glorious quest,<br>
  That my heart will lie peaceful and calm,<br>
  When Iâ€™m laid to my rest.
  <br><br>

  And the world will be better for this,<br>
  That one man, scorned and covered with scars,<br>
  Still strove with his last ounce of courage,<br>
  To reach the unreachable star.
  <br><br>
